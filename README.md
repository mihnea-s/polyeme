# Polyeme

Polyeme is a scheme inspired language,
implemented in as many languages as I could learn.

It's implementation is done in two steps:

1. A static library (when applicable) `Polyeme`,
  that handles scaning, parsing and interpreting

2. An executable `Polymer` which handles
  interactions with the user via stdio

Check `OVERVIEW.plm` and `TESTSUITE.plm` to see the
language in use.
